# The Importance of Documentation in FOSS

<!-- 📝 **Instruction**: This file is currently empty and needs original content. Please write a short article (2–3 paragraphs) explaining this topic clearly. Make sure it's relevant to Bitcoin and open source development. -->

In Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), good documentation helps people understand how to use and contribute to a project. Since FOSS doesn’t usually have a support team, guides and clear instructions are key to helping users and developers get started.

This is especially true for Bitcoin. It’s a complex system involving cryptography, wallets, mining, and nodes. Without proper documentation, new users might make mistakes or feel lost, and developers may struggle to build secure tools.

Documentation also helps keep the project organized. As Bitcoin grows and changes, written guides explain how things work and why certain decisions were made. This helps current and future contributors avoid bugs and improve the system safely.

Finally, strong documentation helps grow the Bitcoin community. When people can understand and trust the software, they are more likely to use it and get involved. In open source, clear writing is just as important as good code.
