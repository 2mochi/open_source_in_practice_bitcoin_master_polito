# Bitcoin and Open Source

Bitcoin is powered by a global community of open source contributors. The software behind Bitcoin, including the Bitcoin Core client, is developed transparently and collaboratively.

FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) principles ensure that:
- The code is auditable and verifiable.
- Anyone can suggest improvements.
- Security vulnerabilities can be identified and fixed by the community.

Projects like Bitcoin Core, LND, BTCPay Server, and Specter Desktop are all open source.

Learning to contribute to these projects empowers individuals and strengthens the Bitcoin ecosystem.
