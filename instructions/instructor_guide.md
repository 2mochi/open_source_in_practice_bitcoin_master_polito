# Instructor Guide

Lesson: *Open Source: Practice*

## Group Coordination
- Students are divided into 3 hybrid groups:
  1. **Group 1 – Content Review**: improves and corrects existing documentation.
  2. **Group 2 – Translation**: translates completed chapters into other languages.
  3. **Group 3 – Structure & Visuals**: enhances layout and provides diagrams.

## Workflow Notes
- Groups are **interdependent**:
  - Translators should wait for finalized content from Group 1 before working.
  - Group 3 will rely on the structure defined in early chapters to propose visual enhancements.

## Suggestions
- Start with Group 1 working on chapters `01_transactions.md` and `05_nodes.md`.
- Group 2 can begin by translating `04_open_source.md`, which is already finalized.
- Clarify timing and dependencies during the session kickoff.
- Wrap up with brief presentations from each group.
